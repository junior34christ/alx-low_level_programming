0x10. C - Variadic functions



0) 0-sum_them_all.c is a function that returns the sum of all its parameters.
Prototype: int sum_them_all(const unsigned int n, ...);
If n == 0, return 0

1) The 1-print_numbers.c is a function that prints numbers, followed by a newline.
Prototype: void print_numbers(const char *separator, const unsigned int n, ...);
If separator is NULL, donâ€™t print it

2) The 2-print_strings.c is a function that prints strings, followed by a newline.
Prototype: void print_strings(const char *separator, const unsigned int n, ...);

3) The 3-print_all.c file is a function that prints anything.

Prototype: void print_all(const char * const format, ...);
where format is a list of argument types passed to the function
c: character
I: whole
f: float
s: char * (if string is NULL, print (nil) instead
any other character should be ignored
see example

You can use the maximum
2 while loops
2 if
You can declare a maximum of 9 variables
You are allowed to use printf
Print a new line at the end of your function




The prototypes of all functions and the prototype of the _putchar function is included in the header file called variadic_functions.h
